Platform will create an avenue where any one with any level of skill can contribute.
Platform will track issues and categorize them based on different criterias and blockchain inches.
Platform will have an active community that supports everyone and encourages effective collaboration when bugs are identified, or when codes are written poorly.
Platform will have organized materials that are broken down with a perfect journey on how one can start as a novice and become a master.
Platform will accept open source projects with solidity as the base language.
Contributors are not limited to coding alone but other forms of skills like design, graphics, product management etc.

Problem statement ::

Ethereum development is a complex and rapidly evolving field, with developers often struggling to find the right projects to contribute to or the resources needed to upskill. 
Existing platforms for open-source contributions are often too generic, lacking the specialized tools and community
support needed for Ethereum development
This creates barriers for both new and experienced
developers to engage effectively with the Ethereum ecosystem.


Other Problems ::

Users of network
High transaction costs
Scalability limitations

Security vulnerabilities
Maintaining compatibility with Ethereum's rapidly evolving protocol
Protocol changes
Interoperability challenges
Competition from better-funded alternatives
Lack of funding
Competitor advantages
Regulatory uncertainty
Complexity
Sustainability concerns
Ethereum based platforms like OnlyDust
Broken down Ideas

Project Aggregation: aggregates GitHub projects and tasks. 


Project Curation: Curates and highlights featured projects. 


Project Listing: Displays featured projects on their website. 


Profile Creation: Possibly allows users to create profiles showcasing their skills.


Search Functionality: Likely allows searching for projects and contributors.


Project Filtering: May offer filters to narrow down projects by criteria. 


Talent Matching: Acts as a matchmaker between GitHub projects and talented contributors. 


Contributor Discovery: Helps developers find suitable projects to contribute to. 


Collaboration Tool: Facilitates collaboration between developers and projects. 


Task Management: Likely allows for task assignment and tracking within aggregated projects. 


Analytics: Likely provides insights on project activity and contributor engagement. 


Ticketing system for issue tracking 


Pull-request mechanism for contributions  


Transparency Project difficulties: project is ranked based on how difficult it should be and funds allocation.

Project visibility : Projects are visible to all, but some are reserved for new developers 

 Project match maker: match each project based on difficulty and funding to skill set based on expertise. 

Platform will track issues and categorize them based on different criterias and blockchain inches. Issues related to niche  Depin Defin Dapps etc or activity eg task, bugs etc 
Issues as Task Management: GitHub Issues are used to manage tasks, bugs, or feature requests. 
Creating Issues: Maintainers or contributors can create issues to track specific tasks. Each issue has a title, description, and relevant labels (e.g., bug, enhancement, help wanted).
Syncing Projects and Issues: Platforms like OnlyDust often integrate with GitHub so that the project tasks (issues) on GitHub are linked to tasks within the platform itself
Assigning Issues: Maintainers can assign issues to contributors via GitHub, which are then reflected on the platform for task management
Matching Based on Skills: The platform can recommend specific issues to contributors based on their skills and experience, making it easier for them to find tasks they can work on.
Claiming Issues: Contributors can claim issues directly through the platform, and their claim will be reflected on the GitHub repository.
Issue Status Updates: When contributors work on an issue, they can change its status (e.g., open, in-progress, closed). The status changes are synced between GitHub and the platform, ensuring everyone remains updated.
Discussions and Comments: GitHub Issues allow contributors and maintainers to comment, ask questions, or provide feedback. These discussions are integral to understanding and completing tasks effectively.
Centralized Management: Contributors and maintainers don’t need to manually switch between the platform and GitHub to see what work is available or who is working on what. Everything is synced.
Transparency: GitHub Issues provide transparency for everyone involved in the project, allowing contributors to understand what work has been completed, what's pending, and what's being actively worked on.
Typical Workflow
Maintainer Creates an Issue: The maintainer defines a new issue in GitHub, with all the details about the task.
Issue Appears on the Platform: The issue is automatically listed on the platform (OnlyDust), categorized with other issues from the same project.
Contributor Selects an Issue: Contributors can browse the platform, find an issue that matches their skill set, and claim it.
Contributions and Updates: The contributor works on the task, provides status updates via GitHub, and ultimately submits the work as a pull request.
Review and Closure: The maintainer reviews the pull request, provides feedback, and eventually merges the change and closes the issue.
Platform will have an active community that supports everyone and encourages effective collaboration when bugs are identified, or when codes are written poorly., Events are done, Grants are given, Mentorship is done, Education Resources development are Encouragement.

Platform will have organized materials that are broken down with a perfect journey on how one can start as a novice and become a master. 

Community will help in breaking down the complexity of solidity code by creating simple libraries 

Contributors are not limited to coding alone but other forms of skills like design, graphics, product management etc.Decentralized labor .
